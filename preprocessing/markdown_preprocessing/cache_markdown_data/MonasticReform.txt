<h1>Monastic Reform Spreads to the Papacy</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.909-1215">909–1215</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Revival within medieval monasticism led to reforms within the church and papacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Western Christendom experienced a period of political and spiritual decline in the ninth century. Under the influence of feudalism, the medieval church struggled to retain its spiritual devotion; meanwhile, monasticism languished as monasteries were destroyed by Viking invaders in search of wealth. Dissatisfied with the state of the church and the encroaching effect of lay control, monastic reformers revived monasticism. This reform movement was characterized by a return to the Rule of Saint Benedict and the establishment of monasteries under the authority of Rome, releasing monastic orders from the control of the laity. The monastic reform movement eventually spread to the papacy. Widespread reforms were established within the Roman Catholic Church as papal reformers sought to reassert the authority of the church and the office of the pope in the continued struggle between church and state. </p>
