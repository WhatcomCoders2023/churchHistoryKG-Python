<h1>Jesus Commissions the Building of His Church</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> c. !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.29-33">29–33</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Following his baptism, Jesus began his ministry in Judea and called the twelve disciples. After his death and resurrection, Jesus gave his disciples the Great Commission, instructing them to make disciples of all nations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Jesus was born in Judea into a Jewish family during a period of political unrest and increasing cultural and religious diversity. Under Roman occupation, various Jewish groups developed, including the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots. While many of the Jews were eagerly awaiting deliverance from the Romans, with some sects actively promoting rebellion, others established harmonious relationships with the empire. As an adult, Jesus entered into public ministry proclaiming the coming of the kingdom of God, a challenge to both the religious and political powers of the time. Jesus' ministry reached its culmination in his death and resurrection, after which he commissioned his disciples to build the church with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
