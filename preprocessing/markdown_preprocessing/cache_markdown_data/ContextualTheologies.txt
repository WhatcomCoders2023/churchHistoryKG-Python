<h1>New Contextual Theologies Emerge to Describe Faith in Light of Human Experience</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1950+10-2022">1950s–Present</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> As Christianity became a global faith, theologies emerged from the perspective of various people groups, especially among those in the Global South. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The latter half of the twentieth century saw the explosive growth of the global church due in part to the successes of the missionary movement of the nineteenth century, which sent Western missionaries---and Western culture---to the non-Western world. Within the next century, colonialism was coming to an end and nationalism was on the rise, leading to a decline in Western influence in the Global South. Indigenous expressions of Christianity flourished as  Christians sought to contextualize theology by taking into account their own human experience within a particular history and culture. A variety of contextual theologies developed as indigenous Christians went about the work of theology.</p>
