<h1>The Rise of Black Churches in North America</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1773-1969">1773–1969</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The Black Church in North America developed as a distinct expression of Christianity within the context of slavery, the Jim Crow era, and the Civil Rights Movement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Black Church in North America emerged out of the encounter of the Christian faith and white supremacy. It developed separately from the distinct, ancient Christian churches in Africa. In diaspora because of the Atlantic slave trade, Africans in the United States and their descendants contextualized Christianity to express their dignity and devotion within the context of slavery, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<h2>Key Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enslaved converts to <a href="bk.%Christianity_Belief">Christianity</a> expressed their faith in spite of the restrictions of slaveholders, leading to unique worship traditions (<a href="date.1700+100+l-1800+100+m">late 1700s–mid-1800s</a>). </li>
<li>Northern, free Blacks established many national <a href="bk.%Denominations">denominations</a> in the face of white exclusion (<a href="date.1800+100+e">early 1800s</a>).</li>

<li>The experience of <a href="bk.tle:jimcroweraunitedstates">Jim Crow</a> forced African American religious leaders to respond in ways which ultimately shaped the role and cultural idea of the Black pastor as civic leader (<a href="date.1877+c-1950+c">c. 1877–c. 1950</a>).</li>
<li>The Black Church’s clergy were integral to the organization and success of the <a href="bk.tle:civilrightsmovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> as a <a href="bk.%nonviolence">non-violent</a>, liturgical protest movement (<a href="date.1954-1968">1954-1968</a>).</li>
<li>Black <a href="bk.%LiberationTheology_Belief">liberation theology</a> developed (<a href="date.1969">1969</a>).</li>
