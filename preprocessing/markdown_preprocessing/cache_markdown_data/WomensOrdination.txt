<h1>Women's Ordination Is Established in Many Protestant Denominations</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1637-2022">1637–Present</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Protestant denominations began ordaining women as pastors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As women stepped into more visible leadership roles both in the church and society, controversy arose around gender roles and the role of women in the church, home, and society. Beginning in the seventeenth century, as Protestantism continued to spread and denominations developed, women began advocating for the right to preach and participate in public ministry. Many women who took on preaching and pastoral roles faced persecution, imprisonment, and violence. Religious revivals and social reform movements provided women greater opportunities to serve in leadership. The missionary movement that began in the nineteenth century was largely the work of Christian women. Women serving in the foreign mission field typically experienced more freedom and less restrictions in how they could minister, many taking up the task of preaching. Despite opposition from supporters of traditional roles for women in the church, women's ordination was established in a number of Protestant denominations by the end of the twentieth century.</p>
