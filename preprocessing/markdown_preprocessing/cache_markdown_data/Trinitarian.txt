<li><strong>Description:</strong> The early church defined the doctrine of the Trinity and identified nontrinitarian heresies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The doctrine of the Trinity was central to the development of early Christian theology during the fourth century. While Trinitarian language developed early in the church, the exact nature and relationship of the three persons in the Trinity were debated. The conversion of Constantine the Great and the acceptance of Christianity in the Roman Empire turned disagreements within the church into potential disruptions to the empire's peace. Church councils were convened to define the doctrine of the Trinity, establish orthodoxy, and identify heresies. While Trinitarianism was affirmed through ecumenical councils, variations of Arianism continued to thrive within the Roman Empire until Nicene Christianity was established as the orthodox religion of the state.</p>
