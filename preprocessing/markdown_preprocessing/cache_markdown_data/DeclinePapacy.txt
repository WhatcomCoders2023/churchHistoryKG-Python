<h1>The Decline of the Papacy in the Middle Ages</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1294-1512">1294–1512</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The decline of papal sovereignty over Europe and rise of national states led to a divided papacy at the end of the Middle Ages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Near the end of the Middle Ages, national states began to develop and expand in Europe as monarchs attempted to consolidate power, weakening a once unified Christendom. As conflicts arose between these developing nations, the authority of the church and papacy in temporal matters was challenged. Throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the church and state struggled to establish their respective authority amidst disputes over taxation and the appointment of church officials. Relations between France and Rome were especially volatile; at one point, France's king Philip IV had the sitting pope, Boniface VIII, kidnapped. Rome's conflict with France soon spread beyond the papacy to the College of Cardinals, causing division when it came time to elect a new pope. Under the growing influence of the French monarchy, the papacy moved to Avignon, which resulted in more conflict between the church and the expanding European monarchies. While the papacy briefly returned to Rome during the tenure of Gregory XI, he died shortly after. The next papal election led to the Great Western Schism; Urban VI's election as pope was quickly disputed, and another pope, Clement VII, was elected. While France supported the Avignon papacy, England gave its support to the Roman popes. For the next four decades, division over the papacy escalated, with two, and later three, rival popes attempting to rule at one time. The Great Western Schism was finally resolved at the Council of Constance with one pope resigning, another deposed, and Martin V elected as the one, true pope. </p>
