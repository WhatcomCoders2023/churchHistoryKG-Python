<li><strong>Description:</strong> Transatlantic revivalism led to the mobilization of missionaries to reach unchurched people groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A period of transatlantic revivals led to a number of new developments within Protestantism, including the establishment of voluntary and missionary societies. While voluntary societies focused on social reforms at home, missionary societies were founded to address the growing concern among Christians for the spread of the gospel and Protestantism abroad. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the number of missionary societies multiplied as hundreds of Western missionaries were commissioned to Africa, Asia, and other non-Western lands. The Roman Catholic Church also experienced a resurgence of foreign mission work and established new missionary orders to promote Catholicism.</p>
