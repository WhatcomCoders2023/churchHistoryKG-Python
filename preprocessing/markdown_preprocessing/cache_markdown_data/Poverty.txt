<h1>The Medieval Poverty Movement Pushes for Church Reform</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1139-1498">1139–1498</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The medieval poverty movement embraced asceticism and encouraged reform within the church. While the movement was generally tolerated within monasticism, the Roman Catholic Church identified some groups and teachings within the movement as heretical. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A return to apostolic poverty within monasticism led to the establishment of new mendicant orders and poverty movements among lay people. The renewed emphasis on asceticism and simplicity stood in stark contrast to the church's accumulation of wealth and extravagances. Rejecting material possessions and embracing voluntary poverty was seen as the Christian ideal, a defining characteristic of the spiritual life. While some sought to reform the church's practices, others took aim at the teachings of the church. The Roman Catholic Church responded by rooting out teachings that criticized the church.</p>
