<h1>Lutheranism Is Established in Germany</h1>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> Pushes for reform in the Roman Catholic Church led to the establishment of Lutheranism in Germany.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Traditionally, the Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther's nailing of the <em>Ninety-Five Theses</em> on the doors of Castle Church in Wittenberg. While a number of factors had prompted earlier calls for reform, including the decline of papal authority in Europe and perceived abuses and corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, it was the church's practice of selling indulgences that Luther initially challenged. Like many Reformers of that time, Luther did not seek to break from the established church, but as his criticisms of Roman Catholic doctrine increased, and his understanding of Christianity developed and became popular under the name Lutheranism, he encountered intense opposition from the Catholic Church. As the Protestant Reformation quickly moved beyond theological and ecclesial issues to political ones, Luther gained the support of the German princes within the Holy Roman Empire who helped challenge papal authority and establish Lutheranism within Germany.</p>
