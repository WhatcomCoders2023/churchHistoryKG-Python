<h1>The Rise of Reason Brings Challenges to Church Authority</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1543-1850">1543–1850</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The rise of rationalism, which advocated for reason as the foundation of knowledge and understanding, brought intellectual challenges to the church's teachings on revelation, tradition, and church authority. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As Europeans began to grapple with the basis of knowledge during the Renaissance and the Reformation, intellectual thinkers challenged the Christian church’s claims to supernatural revelation. Rationalism, which emphasizes human reason as the basis of knowledge, and empiricism, which emphasizes the senses and experience, developed as major movements of thinking which challenged traditional authority figures. These influential movements contributed to a larger movement known as “The Enlightenment” or the Age of Reason. While these questions of authority and tradition raised would not be resolved, Christian thinkers defended the faith against such challenges.</p>
