<h1>Christianity and the Roman Empire Unite</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.312-476">312–476</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Christianity was accepted within the Roman Empire and was later established as the official religion of the state.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>After centuries of persecution, Christianity entered a new era of tolerance under the Roman Empire. The conversion of Roman emperors eventually led to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the empire, uniting the power and interests of the church and state. The church grew under the protection of the empire while navigating controversies related to Christology and the Trinity. The integration of church and state also led to conflicts between bishops and emperors as they each sought to establish their institutions as the supreme authority. </p>
