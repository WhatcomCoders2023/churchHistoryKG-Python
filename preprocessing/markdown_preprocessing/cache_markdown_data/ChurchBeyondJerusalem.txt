<h1>The Early Church Expands Beyond Jerusalem</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.33-312">33–312</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The early church grew rapidly in its early years as it expanded across the Roman Empire.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In its early years, Christianity existed within Judaism. Despite conflicts between Christians and Jews, the church experienced rapid growth under the leadership of the apostles following the events of Pentecost. The destruction of Jerusalem pushed the early church beyond its Jewish context, and the new Jewish sect became a predominantly gentile religion through missional efforts that spread the Gospel throughout the Mediterranean. While Jewish Christianity declined, gentile Christianity flourished throughout the Roman Empire.</p>
