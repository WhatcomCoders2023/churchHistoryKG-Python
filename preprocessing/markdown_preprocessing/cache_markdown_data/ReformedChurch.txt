<h1>The Reformed Church Is Established in Switzerland</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1522-1566">1522–1566</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Zwinglian reform in Zurich merged with the Calvinism of Geneva to establish the Reformed Church after diverging from Lutheranism. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While the Lutheran Reformation was taking place in Germany, Protestantism was also developing among Reformers in the Swiss Confederation. In the city of Zurich, the Swiss preacher Ulrich Zwingli led the calls for reform, challenging the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. By 1525, Zurich had abolished the Mass and embraced Protestantism. The spread of Protestantism in the Swiss Confederation eventually led to civil war between the Protestant and Roman Catholic cantons, during which Zwingli was killed. The Swiss Reformation continued to spread under the leadership of John Calvin. After fleeing from France, Calvin settled in Geneva and helped define the doctrine and theology of the Reformed faith. Calvinism soon spread to other parts of Europe as the Reformed Church was established.</p>
