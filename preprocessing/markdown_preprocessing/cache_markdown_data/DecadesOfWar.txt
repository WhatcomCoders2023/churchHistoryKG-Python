<h1>Protestants and Catholics Forge Peace after Decades of War</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1555-1648">1555-1648</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Clashes between Protestants and Roman Catholics, along with political and economic strife, led to decades of war in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>After a settlement was reached with the Peace of Augsburg, the Holy Roman Empire was divided into Lutheran and Roman Catholic states in an attempt to end the political and religious struggle that arose during the Reformation. As Protestantism continued to spread across the empire and European states expanded, new conflicts arose that eventually led to war. While there were further attempts to reconcile Protestants with the Roman Catholic Church, the political aims of European rulers and the theological distinctives of a diversifying Protestantism proved insurmountable. Decades later, with establishment of the Peace of Westphalia, Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism were legally recognized in the Holy Roman Empire. In addition to greater religious toleration, some states gained independence or expanded territories.</p>
