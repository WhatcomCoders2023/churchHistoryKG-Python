<h1>The Spread of Monasticism</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.270-540">270–540</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Individuals sought out life in the desert as the Roman Empire adopted the Christian faith. Eventually, solitary ascetics and hermits formed communities and established norms for monastic life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Some of the earliest Christian ascetics were those who fled to the wilderness during times of persecution. After the Roman Empire adopted Christianity and persecution declined, some Christians fled to the desert in pursuit of a deeper spiritual life separate from the comfort of the empire. At first, Christian ascetics lived in solitude. Later, desert monks and nuns began to organize into communities, establishing a closer relationship to the institutional church and adopting rules to guide monastic life. Monasticism spread across the empire and was a dominant force behind the growth of the church.</p>
