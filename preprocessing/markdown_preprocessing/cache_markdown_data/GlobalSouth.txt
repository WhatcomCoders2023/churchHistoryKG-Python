<h1>The Church Flourishes in the Global South</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1900-2022">1900-Present</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Christianity transitioned from a predominantly Western to non-Western religion during the twentieth century as church growth exploded in the Global South. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While Christianity has long had a presence in Africa, Asia, and, more recently, Latin America, the twentieth century saw the dramatic expansion of the church in the Global South. Globalization, which allowed for the easy transmission of ideas, as well as the missionary movement of the nineteenth century and the ecumenical and charismatic movements of the twentieth century, helped to spread the gospel and stimulate church growth among non-Western peoples. </p>
