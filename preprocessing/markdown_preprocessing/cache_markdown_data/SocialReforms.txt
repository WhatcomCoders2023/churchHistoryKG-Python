<h1>The Church Pushes for Social Reform in the Industrialized West</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1770-1920">1770–1920</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Christians advocated for social reforms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Industrial Revolution brought about sweeping changes to society. As more people moved into cities, they were confronted with widespread social injustices, such as poverty and poor labor conditions. The Second Great Awakening in the United States and the Evangelical Awakening in Great Britain renewed interests within the church to not only evangelize society but to influence it. Christians focused on a variety of social reforms in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including the abolition of slavery, women's rights, and temperance. Social reform also shaped Christian politics, economics, and theology; movements like the Social Gospel and Christian Socialism attempted to apply Christian ethics to social institutions. Activists and social reformers achieved wide-reaching reforms that helped improve society as a whole.</p>
