<h1>Controversies over Sin and Grace Are Addressed</h1>

<li><strong>Description:</strong> The early church debated the nature of sin and grace and its relation to baptized members of the church.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Schisms and controversies arose within the early church after periods of persecution. The Roman Empire had required Christians to offer pagan sacrifices, hand over sacred texts to be burned, and other acts that were against the Christian faith. After persecution subsided, the early church began to debate how lapsed Christians were to be treated. While some church leaders advocated for the readmission of those who repented and completed penance, others insisted that the church was a place for saints---namely, those who had not fallen back into sin after conversion. Further debates over the nature of sin, grace, human will, and forgiveness arose as the church continued to develop its theology and doctrine. Schisms and controversies that were deemed unorthodox were condemned as the church further defined its doctrine of soteriology and the nature of the church.</p>
