<h1>Twentieth-Century Ideologies Threaten to Divide and Stagnate the Church</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.1914-1991">1914–1991</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Competing ideologies led to worldwide conflicts and civil unrest in the twentieth century. Christians struggled to maintain unity as these ideologies threatened to divide the church and stagnate its mission and influence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The rise of modernism and decline of Christendom made room for new ideologies to take root in the hearts and minds of twentieth-century societies. These ideological changes created global political challenges, as well as challenges for the global Christian church, which grappled with is role in society and politics. Nationalism, communism, and individualism were among the most prominent and influential post-Christian ideologies.[^1] As nationalism developed in the nineteenth century, the influence of religion declined as people began to identify more strongly with their nation-states. A variety of ideologies, such as communism, Nazism, and fascism, developed out of nationalism, with the interests of the nation-state and its people of utmost importance. Conflict erupted as these ideologies came into conflict with one another, resulting in two World Wars. While fascism and Nazism experienced a decline after World War II, communism continued to spread in Eastern Europe, Cuba, and in parts of Asia. During the Cold War, the world was divided over those who supported communism and those who were against it, a divide drawn along national lines between East and West. Ethnic and racial tensions in the United States and South Africa led to civil disruptions and divisions within the church. While the global impact of the Age of Ideology proved challenging for the church, Christianity continued to spread across the globe and found unity in the twentieth-century ecumenical movement.</p>
