<h1>The Rise of Scholasticism</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.789-1500">789–1500</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A method of learning that emphasized the use of reason to establish systematic theological systems developed in the Middle Ages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A renewed interest in learning during the Carolingian Renaissance in Western Europe led to the establishment of schools in monasteries and cathedrals, and eventually universities. The production of Latin translations of ancient Greek philosophical works reintroduced classical literature to the West and prompted theologians to incorporate the use of reason in their theological pursuits and support of the Christian faith. This led to the development of scholasticism as an intellectual method using Aristotelian concepts and methods. While many theologians saw a conflict between Greek philosophy and Christian theology, others argued that the two were not incompatible and sought to harmonize faith and reason. Scholasticism reached its culmination in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a period known as High Scholasticism, characterized by the founding of universities and rich scholarship from some of the brightest scholastic thinkers. By the late Middle Ages, scholasticism was in decline.</p>
