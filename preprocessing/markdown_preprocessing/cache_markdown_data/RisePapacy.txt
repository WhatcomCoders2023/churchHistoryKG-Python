<h1>The Rise of the Papacy</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.325-800">325–800</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> The authority of the Western church was centralized in Rome under the papacy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The power of the bishop grew in Rome as the church continued to expand across the Roman and Byzantine Empires. While the church in the East recognized the equal rule of five ecumenical patriarchs, the church in the West recognized the pope as the supreme head of the church. Rome established papal primacy, the supreme ecclesial authority of the pope and bishop of Rome over the universal church, based on the primacy of Peter. As Peter was the first among equals among the twelve apostles, and traditionally considered the first bishop of Rome appointed by Jesus (Matt 16:18–19), so, too, were the bishops of Rome who succeeded him. The power, prestige, and authority of the papacy continued to grow as the Western church expanded.</p>
