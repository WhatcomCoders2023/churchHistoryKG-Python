<h1>The Early Church Is Persecuted</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period:</strong> !!smallcaps|ad!! <a href="date.64-312">64–312</a></li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Christians experienced persecution within the Roman Empire during the first few centuries after the birth of the church.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>As the church stepped out on its own and spread across the Roman Empire, followers of Jesus faced persecution and martyrdom. At first, persecution consisted of sporadic, isolated events, but the threat to those called "Christians" eventually became widespread as punishment and violence were sanctioned by the emperors of Rome. Christian apologists came to the defense of the new faith, advocating for tolerance and acceptance of Christianity while encouraging followers to remain faithful in the face of persecution and martyrdom.</p>
