<li><strong>Description:</strong> The early church defined its doctrine of the person of Christ and the nature of the incarnation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Christology was central to the development of early Christian theology as the early church debated the person and work of Christ, as well as the nature of the incarnation. Two dominant schools of thought developed in the catechetical schools at Alexandria and Antioch. While Alexandrian Christology emphasized the divinity of Jesus and the unity of his person, Antiochene Christology emphasized the humanity of Jesus and the duality of his person. Church councils were convened to define the doctrine of the nature and work of Christ, as well as identify christological heresies. Chalcedonian Christianity was established as orthodoxy, affirming the hypostatic union of Jesus' human and divine nature.</p>
