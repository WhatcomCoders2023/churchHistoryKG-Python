Post-Reformation Protestantism Refines Its Orthodoxy
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1560--1700
Description: Protestant orthodoxy was defined during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries through confessional documents and theological polemics.
"Summary: While Roman Catholic and Protestant armies were engaged in political battles following the Reformation, scholars and theologians engaged in polemical battles over dogma."
"A revivalism of scholasticism and the methods of Aristotle led to the development of Lutheran, Reformed, and Puritan orthodoxies."
"Confessional documents were written to identify and define doctrinal distinctives within these Protestant denominations, as well as reject teachings and beliefs that were deemed unorthodox to their particular expression of Protestantism."
Key Developments
Divisions among Protestants deepened as doctrine was refined and solidified in confessional statements (mid-1500s–1600s).
"Protestant scholasticism developed as a theological method among Lutheran, Reformed, and Puritan theologians, reestablishing Aristotelianism as a method for developing theology (mid-1500s–1600s)."
Protestant denominations established orthodoxy in confessional statements (mid-1500s–1600s).
Protestants engaged in polemics to defend their orthodoxy against Roman Catholicism (mid-1500s–1600s).
Protestant scholars and theologians defined and defended orthodox methods of biblical interpretation and the authority of the Bible (mid 1500s–1600s).
Many polyglot Bibles and commentaries were published (late 1500s–1600s).
Covenant theology was developed by Reformed theologians (late 1500s–1600s).
Pietism developed in response to Lutheran orthodoxy (1600s–1700s).
