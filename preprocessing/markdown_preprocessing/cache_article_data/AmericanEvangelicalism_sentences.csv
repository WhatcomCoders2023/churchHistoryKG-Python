American Evangelicalism Diverges As it Responds to Modernism
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1859-present
Description: American evangelicalism responded to modernism with varied approaches to the changing culture.
Evangelicalism rose to prominence in American society and politics in the second half of the twentieth century.
"Summary: Evangelicalism, which emphasizes personal conversion (or spiritual rebirth) and evangelism, is a diverse movement within the United States and has played an influential role in shaping contemporary American culture and politics."
"At the turn of the twentieth century, Protestant evangelicals were deeply divided over how the church should approach the challenges facing modern society, as well as how to respond to Protestant liberalism."
Advances in science and modern society brought changes to American culture and challenges to traditional authority and the objectivity of truth.
"While some in evangelicals attempted to thwart any modern influences on the faith, others embraced modernism in an attempt to reconcile new discoveries with Christianity in the hopes of affirming the relevancy of the faith to modern times."
"Neo-evangelicalism emerged among those who sought a middle way, a compromise between fundamentalism and modernism."
"This new evangelical movement was eager to engage the culture, unlike the fundamentalists, and remained affirming of traditional evangelical beliefs like biblical inerrancy, contrary to modernists."
"By the mid-twentieth century, neo-evangelicalism was on the rise largely due to the evangelical crusades of Billy Graham and establishment of evangelical organizations and universities."
American evangelicalism continued to diversify with the emergence of the conservative evangelical right and progressive evangelical left.
