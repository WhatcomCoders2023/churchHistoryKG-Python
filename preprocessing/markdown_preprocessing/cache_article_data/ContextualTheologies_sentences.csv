ContextualTheologies
New Contextual Theologies Emerge to Describe Faith in Light of Human Experience
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1950s–Present
"Description: As Christianity became a global faith, theologies emerged from the perspective of various people groups, especially among those in the Global South."
"Summary: The latter half of the twentieth century saw the explosive growth of the global church due in part to the successes of the missionary movement of the nineteenth century, which sent Western missionaries---and Western culture---to the non-Western world."
"Within the next century, colonialism was coming to an end and nationalism was on the rise, leading to a decline in Western influence in the Global South."
Indigenous expressions of Christianity flourished as  Christians sought to contextualize theology by taking into account their own human experience within a particular history and culture.
A variety of contextual theologies developed as indigenous Christians went about the work of theology.
Key Developments
Missionaries from North America and Europe exported Western culture to non-Western people groups (late 1700s–early 1900s).
"Missionaries and theologians began applying the indigenous principle to their work to help develop indigenous churches that were reflective of the culture, language, and history of the people (1900s)."
Contextual theologies emerged among various people groups to address specific cultural experiences and contexts (mid-1900s–2022). 
"Liberation theologies developed among oppressed and marginalized people groups who sought to interpret the gospel and Scripture within their social, political, and economic context (1968–2022)."
