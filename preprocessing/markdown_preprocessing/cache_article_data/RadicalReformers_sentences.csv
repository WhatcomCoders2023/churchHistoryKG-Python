Radical Reformers Diverge from Magisterial Protestants
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1523–1542
"Description: Dissatisfied with the German and Swiss Reformations, those known as Radical[^1] Reformers pushed for greater reforms in the church and its relation to the state powers."
"Summary: Radical Reformers, those who sought to revive what they believed to be primitive Christianity, are often categorized into three main groups: 1) the mainstream Anabaptists, known for their practice of believers' baptism and appeal to Scripture as the ultimate authority; 2) the Spiritualists, who were influenced by mysticism and advocated for the inner word of God; 3) and the Rationalists, known for their rejection of Nicene Trinitarianism and emphasis on human reason."
"[^2] There were also those among the Radical Reformers who advocated for a more revolutionary, and at times violent, approach to reform."
"The Anabaptists took an alternative approach to revolution, opting instead for various forms of pacifism."
"While the Radical Reformers were diverse in their beliefs and approaches to reform, they had in common a desire to re-establish the church as it was in the New Testament, a church separate from the world and its institutions."
