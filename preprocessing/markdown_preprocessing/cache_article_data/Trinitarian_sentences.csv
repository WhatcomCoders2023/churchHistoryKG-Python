Trinitarian Controversies Are Settled
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 180-388
Description: The early church defined the doctrine of the Trinity and identified nontrinitarian heresies.
Summary: The doctrine of the Trinity was central to the development of early Christian theology during the fourth century.
"While Trinitarian language developed early in the church, the exact nature and relationship of the three persons in the Trinity were debated."
The conversion of Constantine the Great and the acceptance of Christianity in the Roman Empire turned disagreements within the church into potential disruptions to the empire's peace.
"Church councils were convened to define the doctrine of the Trinity, establish orthodoxy, and identify heresies."
"While Trinitarianism was affirmed through ecumenical councils, variations of Arianism continued to thrive within the Roman Empire until Nicene Christianity was established as the orthodox religion of the state."
Key Developments
Early church fathers developed the doctrine of the Trinity in their writings (100s–300s).
"The term ""Trinity"" was used to describe the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (c. 180–184)."
Competing Christologies developed within the Antiochene and Alexandrian schools as theologians debated the nature of Jesus' person and divinity (mid-100s–500s).
Arianism and other nontrinitarian views developed within early Christianity and were debated within the church (200s–300s).
The First Council of Nicaea defined orthodox Trinitarianism in the Nicene Creed (325).
The church affirmed the divinity of the Son who is co-equal and co-eternal with the Father (325).
Nicene Christianity was established as orthodox catholic Christianity by the Roman Empire under Theodosius I (380).
Arianism and other nontrinitarian views were condemned as heresy by the ecumenical councils (325-381).
The church affirmed the divinity of the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father (381).
The Nicene Crede was reaffirmed and amended at the First Council of Constantinople (381).
