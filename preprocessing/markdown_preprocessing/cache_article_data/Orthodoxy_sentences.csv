Orthodoxy
The Rise of Orthodoxy in the Early Church
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 70-393
"Description: The church began to establish teachings, sacred texts, and practices following the apostolic age."
"Summary: As Christianity expanded throughout the Roman Empire, a catholic, or universal, faith developed."
The early church established theological boundaries in response to emerging movements that contradicted the core teachings of Christianity.
The formation of the New Testament canon helped define Christian orthodoxy and identify beliefs that were deemed heretical.
The rise of orthodoxy also led to increased uniformity in the church's worship and organization.
Key Developments
The early church developed its liturgy and sacraments (first–second century).
Bishops whose writings influenced emerging orthodoxy grew in influence (first–fourth century).
Early creeds developed in the church to accompany baptism and as expressions of orthodox Christian doctrine against heresy (100s).
Early Christian theology developed as Christians interacted with other worldviews (100s–200s).
The church identified early heresies that were outside the bounds of orthodox Christianity (100s–300s).
The teachings of the apostles were passed on through the Rule of Faith (180–325).
The New Testament canon was established as early Christian writings were circulated among the churches (mid-300s).
