Poverty
The Medieval Poverty Movement Pushes for Church Reform
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1139–1498
Description: The medieval poverty movement embraced asceticism and encouraged reform within the church.
"While the movement was generally tolerated within monasticism, the Roman Catholic Church identified some groups and teachings within the movement as heretical."
Summary: A return to apostolic poverty within monasticism led to the establishment of new mendicant orders and poverty movements among lay people.
The renewed emphasis on asceticism and simplicity stood in stark contrast to the church's accumulation of wealth and extravagances.
"Rejecting material possessions and embracing voluntary poverty was seen as the Christian ideal, a defining characteristic of the spiritual life."
"While some sought to reform the church's practices, others took aim at the teachings of the church."
The Roman Catholic Church responded by rooting out teachings that criticized the church.
Key Developments
Apostolic poverty was reestablished as the Christian ideal (1100s–1200s).
Voluntary poverty rose among lay people (1100s–1200s).
"The Roman Catholic Church tasked bishops, and eventually the temporal powers of the state, with discovering and punishing heretics (late 1100s–1200s)."
"Dissidents accused the Roman Catholic Church, and more specifically, the papacy, of worldliness and corruption (1100s–1400s)."
New mendicant orders were established that prohibited owning personal property and relied on begging for provisions (early 1200s).
Heresy was punished as treason and heretics were burned alive (mid-1200s).
Medieval Reformers challenged papal authority and church doctrine (1300s–1400s).
