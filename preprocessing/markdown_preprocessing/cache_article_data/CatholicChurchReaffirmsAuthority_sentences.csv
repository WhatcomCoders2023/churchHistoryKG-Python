The Roman Catholic Church Reaffirms Its Authority and Rejects Modernism
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1776–1929
"Description:  As the temporal authority of the pope waned, the Roman Catholic Church reaffirmed the supreme authority of the pope in spiritual matters."
Summary: The modern age brought many challenges to the Roman Catholic Church in the form of secularization and liberalism.
"The separation between church and state---and the end of Christendom---was solidified as revolution, which pushed for democratic rule, swept through Europe."
"While papal authority over the state was abolished, the Roman Catholic Church reaffirmed the pope's supreme authority in matters of faith with the doctrine of papal infallibility."
"Beyond politics, modernism was also making an impact on Christian theology, notably in the form of Protestant liberalism."
"While some Roman Catholic scholars and theologians chose to engage with these modern developments, modernism was ultimately condemned by the papacy."
