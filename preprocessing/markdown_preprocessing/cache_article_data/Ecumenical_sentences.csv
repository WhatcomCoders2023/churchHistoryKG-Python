The Ecumenical Movement Unites Denominations
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1908–Present
Description: The ecumenical movement led to renewed relationships within the universal church.
"Summary: Ecumenism, a movement that promoted unity and cooperation within the universal church, developed in part out of the foreign missionary movement of the nineteenth century."
"While Christianity has a long history of denominations dividing over doctrine and practice, from the Great Schism between East and West to the diversifying of Protestantism, the beginning of the twentieth century saw the universal church unite around a common goal of evangelism."
"The ecumenical movement emphasized Christian cooperation across not only denominational lines, but geographical boundaries, as churches across the globe collaborated to form the World Council of Churches."
"The Roman Catholic Church, in the spirit of ecumenism, appealed to unity and closer relations with the Orthodox and Protestant churches."
"While maintaining doctrinal distinctives, the universal church affirmed its common central belief in Jesus Christ."
