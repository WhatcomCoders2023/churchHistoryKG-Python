The Rise of Reason Brings Challenges to Church Authority
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1543–1850
"Description: The rise of rationalism, which advocated for reason as the foundation of knowledge and understanding, brought intellectual challenges to the church's teachings on revelation, tradition, and church authority."
"Summary: As Europeans began to grapple with the basis of knowledge during the Renaissance and the Reformation, intellectual thinkers challenged the Christian church’s claims to supernatural revelation."
"Rationalism, which emphasizes human reason as the basis of knowledge, and empiricism, which emphasizes the senses and experience, developed as major movements of thinking which challenged traditional authority figures."
These influential movements contributed to a larger movement known as “The Enlightenment” or the Age of Reason.
"While these questions of authority and tradition raised would not be resolved, Christian thinkers defended the faith against such challenges."
Key Developments
The Renaissance in Europe and the rise of humanism led to a more positive view of humanity (1400s–1500s).
The Protestant Reformation challenged traditional sources of authority and religious dogma (1517–1648).
"Modern science was developed during the Scientific Revolution, and advances led to a new understanding of the universe (1543–1687)."
The Enlightenment and the rise of rationalism emphasized human reason as the primary source of knowledge (1600s–1700s).
Supernatural revelation was viewed in opposition to human reason and natural knowledge (1600s–1700s).
Some theologians argued that the Christian faith was not opposed to reason but that special revelation was consistent with reason (1600s–1700s).
The church's influence on culture and politics declined (1600s–1700s).
"Deism, the belief in a supreme being based on reason and natural theology, became popular in Europe (mid-1600s–mid-1700s)."
