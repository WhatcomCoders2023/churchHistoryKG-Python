Missionaries Mobilize to Reach the Unchurched
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1792–1910
Description: Transatlantic revivalism led to the mobilization of missionaries to reach unchurched people groups.
"Summary: A period of transatlantic revivals led to a number of new developments within Protestantism, including the establishment of voluntary and missionary societies."
"While voluntary societies focused on social reforms at home, missionary societies were founded to address the growing concern among Christians for the spread of the gospel and Protestantism abroad."
"Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the number of missionary societies multiplied as hundreds of Western missionaries were commissioned to Africa, Asia, and other non-Western lands."
The Roman Catholic Church also experienced a resurgence of foreign mission work and established new missionary orders to promote Catholicism.
Key Developments
Missionary societies were established by Protestants to support foreign missions (late 1700s–1800s).
Transatlantic spiritual revivals led to a renewed interest in evangelism (late 1700s–early 1900s).
"Missionaries spread Western culture through foreign missions, establishing new churches, schools, and orphanages (late 1700s–early 1900s)."
Missionary societies recruited single women and young people to embark on foreign missions with the goal of converting individuals and establishing churches among unreached people groups (1800s).
The Roman Catholic Church established new missionary orders to support foreign missions (1868–1869).
