Description: The authority of the Western church was centralized in Rome under the papacy.

"As Peter was the first among equals among the twelve apostles, and traditionally considered the first bishop of Rome appointed by Jesus (Matt 16:18–19), so, too, were the bishops of Rome who succeeded him."
