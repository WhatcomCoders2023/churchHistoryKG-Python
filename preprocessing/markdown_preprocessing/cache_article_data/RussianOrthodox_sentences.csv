The Rise of the Russian Orthodox Church
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1453–1917
"Description: As Russia navigated foreign influences while attempting to maintain traditional ideals, the Russian Orthodox Church worked to establish its authority within the growing empire."
"Summary: After the fall of Constantinople, Moscow was primed to become the ""third Rome"" and the new center of Orthodox Christianity, the Russian Tsars taking on the role of Christian emperor."
The church and state in Russia became deeply entwined as the new Patriarchate of Moscow rose to prominence with the support of the Tsar.
Schism threatened to weaken the church when conflict erupted between Russian traditionalists and supporters of reform that would bring Russian liturgy more in line with the practices of the Greek Orthodox churches.
"The church experienced additional setbacks when Peter the Great officially subjected the church to the state with the establishment of the Russian Holy Synod, a governing body made up of bishops."
"The office of the patriarch was abolished, leaving the church under the supreme authority of the Russian emperor."
The church continued to navigate the balance between maintaining traditional Russian ideals and the expanding influence of the Western world.
"Despite the restoration of the Patriarchate of Moscow at the beginning of the Russian Revolution, the power and influence of the Russian Orthodox Church declined with the loss of the support from the new state government."
