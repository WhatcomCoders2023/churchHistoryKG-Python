Monastic Reform Spreads to the Papacy
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 909–1215
Description: Revival within medieval monasticism led to reforms within the church and papacy.
Summary: Western Christendom experienced a period of political and spiritual decline in the ninth century.
"Under the influence of feudalism, the medieval church struggled to retain its spiritual devotion; meanwhile, monasticism languished as monasteries were destroyed by Viking invaders in search of wealth."
"Dissatisfied with the state of the church and the encroaching effect of lay control, monastic reformers revived monasticism."
"This reform movement was characterized by a return to the Rule of Saint Benedict and the establishment of monasteries under the authority of Rome, releasing monastic orders from the control of the laity."
The monastic reform movement eventually spread to the papacy.
Widespread reforms were established within the Roman Catholic Church as papal reformers sought to reassert the authority of the church and the office of the pope in the continued struggle between church and state.
Key Developments
The rise of feudalism placed churches and monasteries under the control of laity (700s–1000s).

Monasteries were destroyed by invaders from Denmark and Norway (800s–900s).
The practice of simony became widespread (800s–1100s).
"New monastic orders were founded with the goal of reforming monasticism through strict adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict, most notably at Cluny and Clairvaux (900s–1000s)."
Monastic reform established independence from the local feudal lords and placed monasteries under the authority of the papacy (900s–1000s).
Celibacy was required for all clergy (1000s).
Several Cluniac monks ascended to the papacy and continued to implement religious reforms within the church (1000s).
The Investiture Controversy was resolved (1076–1122).
The power of the church was centralized under the papacy (1215).
