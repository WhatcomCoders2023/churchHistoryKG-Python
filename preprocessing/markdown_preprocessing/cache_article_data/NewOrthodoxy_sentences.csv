New Orthodoxy Develops in Response to Protestant Liberalism
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1914–1945
"Description: In the aftermath of World War I, a dialectical theology developed in response to what Neo-Orthodox scholars saw as the failures of Protestant liberalism's optimistic view of humanity."
"Summary: Like Protestant liberalism, the Neo-Orthodox movement, also known as dialectical theology or crisis theology, was a diverse theological movement that developed in Germany."
"The moral crises of the early twentieth century, from World War I to the rise of Nazi Germany, led some theologians to challenge the ideas of Protestant liberalism."
"While Neo-Orthodox theologians were typically united in their opposition to the theology of liberalism and its optimistic views of human nature and the progress of human history, disagreements were frequent and often led to splits among its adherents."
"The movement flourished in Europe throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but eventually declined."
Key Developments
Nationalism led to a rise in totalitarian regimes and a greater emphasis on national identities (late 1800s–early 1900s.
"World War I challenged liberalism's optimism regarding human nature, sin, and the progress of history (1914–1918)."
Neo-Orthodoxy developed in response to perceived inadequacies of Protestant liberalism and the aftermath of World War I (early 1900s).
"The dialectical method, which set two seemingly contradictory ideas in comparison, was applied to the study of theology (early 1900s)."
The transcendence of God was emphasized over attempts to explain or define God in human terms (early 1900s).
"Revelation was emphasized over natural theology for gaining knowledge of God; knowledge of God was impossible without divine revelation, most notably the revelation in the incarnation of Jesus (early 1900s)."
The Jesus of faith was emphasized over the historical Jesus (early 1900s).
Some theologians advocated for the demythologization of the New Testament in order to communicate the kerygma of the Gospels to a modern world (1940s).
