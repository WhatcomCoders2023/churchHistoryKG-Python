Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1522–1566
Description: Zwinglian reform in Zurich merged with the Calvinism of Geneva to establish the Reformed Church after diverging from Lutheranism.

"In the city of Zurich, the Swiss preacher Ulrich Zwingli led the calls for reform, challenging the authority of the Roman Catholic Church."
"By 1525, Zurich had abolished the Mass and embraced Protestantism."
"The spread of Protestantism in the Swiss Confederation eventually led to civil war between the Protestant and Roman Catholic cantons, during which Zwingli was killed."
