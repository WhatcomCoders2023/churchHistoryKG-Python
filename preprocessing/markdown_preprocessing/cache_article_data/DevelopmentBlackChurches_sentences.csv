The Rise of Black Churches in North America
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1773–1969
"Description: The Black Church in North America developed as a distinct expression of Christianity within the context of slavery, the Jim Crow era, and the Civil Rights Movement."
Summary: The Black Church in North America emerged out of the encounter of the Christian faith and white supremacy.
"It developed separately from the distinct, ancient Christian churches in Africa."
"In diaspora because of the Atlantic slave trade, Africans in the United States and their descendants contextualized Christianity to express their dignity and devotion within the context of slavery, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights Movement."
Key Developments
"Enslaved converts to Christianity expressed their faith in spite of the restrictions of slaveholders, leading to unique worship traditions (late 1700s–mid-1800s). "
"Northern, free Blacks established many national denominations in the face of white exclusion (early 1800s)."
"Southern, white slaveholders resisted the independent churches of Black Americans, fearing gospel preaching and worship would lead to emancipation (first half of the 1800s. "
"After emancipation, Black Americans were generally expelled from white congregations (second half of the 1800s."
"Emancipation and the Great Migration led to the establishment of additional Black denominations, with theological diversity ranging from mainline denominations to independent, fundamentalist denominations (1863–1970)."
The experience of Jim Crow forced African American religious leaders to respond in ways which ultimately shaped the role and cultural idea of the Black pastor as civic leader (c. 1877–c. 1950).
"The Black Church’s clergy were integral to the organization and success of the Civil Rights Movement as a non-violent, liturgical protest movement (1954-1968)."
Black liberation theology developed (1969).
The post-Civil Rights Era has provoked divergence and synthesis in various Black American traditions (1968–2022).
