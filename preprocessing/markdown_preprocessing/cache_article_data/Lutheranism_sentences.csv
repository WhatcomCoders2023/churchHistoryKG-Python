Lutheranism
Lutheranism Is Established in Germany
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1510–1555
Description: Pushes for reform in the Roman Catholic Church led to the establishment of Lutheranism in Germany.
"Summary: Traditionally, the Protestant Reformation began with Martin Luther's nailing of the Ninety-Five Theses on the doors of Castle Church in Wittenberg."
"While a number of factors had prompted earlier calls for reform, including the decline of papal authority in Europe and perceived abuses and corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, it was the church's practice of selling indulgences that Luther initially challenged."
"Like many Reformers of that time, Luther did not seek to break from the established church, but as his criticisms of Roman Catholic doctrine increased, and his understanding of Christianity developed and became popular under the name Lutheranism, he encountered intense opposition from the Catholic Church."
"As the Protestant Reformation quickly moved beyond theological and ecclesial issues to political ones, Luther gained the support of the German princes within the Holy Roman Empire who helped challenge papal authority and establish Lutheranism within Germany."
Key Developments
The Roman Catholic Church began selling indulgences to raise money during the Crusades (1095–1291).
Martin Luther protested the selling of indulgences and argued that salvation was by faith in Christ alone (early 1500s).
"Luther challenged papal authority, arguing that Scripture alone holds authority for establishing doctrine (early 1500s)."
Luther initiated reforms in church leadership by abolishing the office of bishop and celibacy (early 1520s).
The Bible and the Latin liturgy were translated into German (1520s–1530s).
"Lutheran church services focused on the preaching of Scripture, and hymn-writing was encouraged (1520s–1540s)."
Monasticism was challenged by Protestant Reformers (1520s–1540s).
Luther found support among the German nobility as Lutheranism spread (1520s–1540s).
German peasants revolted against the nobility but were condemned by Luther after turning violent (1524–1525).
Emperor Charles V attempted to suppress the growing Lutheran movement and defeated the Schmalkaldic League (1546–1547).
Lutheranism was officially recognized in the Holy Roman Empire (1555).
