Spiritual Renewal in the West Emphasizes Personal Piety and Faith
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1654-1797
Description: Evangelical revivals in North America and Great Britain were influenced by German Pietism and English Puritanism.
"These renewal movements emphasized personal conversion, religious devotion, and evangelism."
"Summary: The solidification of Protestant orthodoxy in the years following the Reformation, which was largely an academic effort, and the increasing spiritual decline in both the church and society during the Enlightenment left many in Christendom longing for a deeper spiritual experience."
The Age of Reason soon gave way to spiritual renewal movements within Protestantism.
"Beginning with German Pietism, a renewal movement that developed in response to Lutheran orthodoxy, conversion, personal faith, and piety were emphasized as the defining characteristics of the Christian life."
"Small groups, or Collegia pietatis (""schools of piety""), were established to facilitate communal Bible study, prayer, and religious devotion."
Pietist missionary efforts were far reaching.
These developments influenced later evangelical revivals in England and North America.
"While Jonathan Edwards was at the forefront of the early years of the Great Awakening in New England, George Whitefield and John Wesley engaged in open-air preaching that led to the Evangelical Revival in England and the establishment of Methodism."
