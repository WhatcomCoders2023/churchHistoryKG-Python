The Catholic Reformation Begins
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1523–1648
Description: The Roman Catholic Church implemented reforms as Protestantism spread through Europe.
"Summary: While the Catholic Reformation was in part a response to the spread of Protestantism, it was also motivated by calls for reform from those within the Roman Catholic Church who acknowledged that Martin Luther and other Protestant Reformers had expressed some legitimate concerns about the state of the church and the papacy."
"A general council was convened to address these calls for reform, meeting over the span of nearly two decades as it debated and reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's teachings on Scripture, tradition, and the sacraments."
A revival within monasticism led to the establishment of new religious orders while a renewed focus on spirituality and the inner life of the soul influenced the resurgence of mysticism.
