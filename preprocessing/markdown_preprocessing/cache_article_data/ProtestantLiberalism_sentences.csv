The Rise of Protestant Liberalism
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1799–1930
Description: Protestant theologians and scholars sought to apply modern intellectual developments to the study of the Bible and Christian theology.
Summary: Protestant liberals adapted Christian orthodoxy to respond to perceived challenges posed by modernism.
Thinkers applied methods that were developed in the natural sciences to the study of the Bible and theology.
Historical-critical scholars insisted on studying the Bible as an ordinary text to discern myth from history in an effort to identify the “historical Jesus” independent from the Jesus of the Gospels.
Other thinkers during this period saw Christian religion as an obstacle to that progress and altogether rejected it.
"While the Roman Catholic Church generally resisted the influence of modernism, some Protestants sought to engage modernism, and their engagement developed into Protestant liberalism."
Key Developments
Scientific discoveries challenged traditional Christian views of the natural world (1800s–1900s).
Atheist intellectuals and philosophers attacked Christianity (1800s–1900s).
"Historical-critical methods were applied to the Bible, known as biblical criticism, to determine its literary history and the meaning of the authors (1800s–1900s)."
"Traditional Christian doctrines were questioned, as was the authority, nature, and trustworthiness of the Bible (1800s–1900s)."
"The immanence of God, God's nearness to creation, was emphasized over God's transcendence (1800s–1900s)."
The fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man were emphasized (1800s–1900s).
Jesus was viewed as humanity's example of achieving perfect knowledge of God and living an ethical life (1800s–1900s).
Many denied the divinity of Jesus and other supernatural elements of Christianity and sought to distinguish the Jesus of history from the Jesus of the Gospels (1800s–1900s).
The ethics of Christianity were emphasized over doctrine; religious experience was also emphasized within Protestant liberalism (1800s–1900s).
