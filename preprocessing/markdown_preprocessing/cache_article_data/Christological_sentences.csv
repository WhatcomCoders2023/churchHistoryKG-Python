Christological Controversies Are Settled
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 325-681
Description: The early church defined its doctrine of the person of Christ and the nature of the incarnation.
"Summary: Christology was central to the development of early Christian theology as the early church debated the person and work of Christ, as well as the nature of the incarnation."
Two dominant schools of thought developed in the catechetical schools at Alexandria and Antioch.
"While Alexandrian Christology emphasized the divinity of Jesus and the unity of his person, Antiochene Christology emphasized the humanity of Jesus and the duality of his person."
"Church councils were convened to define the doctrine of the nature and work of Christ, as well as identify christological heresies."
"Chalcedonian Christianity was established as orthodoxy, affirming the hypostatic union of Jesus' human and divine nature."
Key Developments
Competing Christologies developed within the Antiochene and Alexandrian catechetical schools as theologians debated the nature of Jesus' person and divinity (mid-100s–500s).
"Extreme expressions of Alexandrian and Antiochene Christology developed, including Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, and Eutychianism (300s–400s)."
"After the divinity of Jesus was affirmed at Nicaea, the church continued to debate the nature of the incarnation and the relation between the Son's humanity and divinity (325–680)."
Unorthodox christological views were condemned as heresy by the ecumenical councils (325–681).
Disagreements over Christology deepened the divide between Eastern and Western Christianity (400s–600s).
The church affirmed the unity of Jesus' person (451).
The church affirmed the two natures of Christ (451).
Some Christians in the East rejected the Council of Chalcedon and split from the church (451).
The church affirmed the two wills of Christ (680).
