The Church Flourishes in the Global South
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1900-Present
Description: Christianity transitioned from a predominantly Western to non-Western religion during the twentieth century as church growth exploded in the Global South.
"Summary: While Christianity has long had a presence in Africa, Asia, and, more recently, Latin America, the twentieth century saw the dramatic expansion of the church in the Global South."
"Globalization, which allowed for the easy transmission of ideas, as well as the missionary movement of the nineteenth century and the ecumenical and charismatic movements of the twentieth century, helped to spread the gospel and stimulate church growth among non-Western peoples."
Key Developments
Pentecostalism and the charismatic movement spread from North America to the Global South (1900s). 
The Bible was translated into hundreds of languages (1900s–2022).
The ecumenical movement encouraged participation in missionary outreach (1908–2022).
"Church growth rapidly increased outside of Europe and North America, primarily in Asia, Latin America, and Africa (1900s–2022)."
Decolonization led to a decline in Western influence and rise in indigenous expressions of Christianity and the appointment of native church leaders (second half of the 1900s).
Mission efforts began to focus on training partnerships to help establish and support indigenous leaders (second half of the 1900s).
Contextual theologies developed to address specific cultural contexts (second half of the 1900s).
Persecution and suppression stimulated church growth through underground movements (second half of the 1900s).
Vatican II led to reforms in the Catholic Church that encouraged the flourishing of Roman Catholicism in the Global South (1962–1965).
