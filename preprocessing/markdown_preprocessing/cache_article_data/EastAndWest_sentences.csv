The Church Separates into East and West
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 330–1215
"Description: As the church developed differently in the East and West, political, cultural, and theological tensions eventually led to the Great Schism."
Summary: The spread of Christianity across the sprawling Roman Empire led to a slow divide between the church in the East and the West.
"While Constantine and the emperors who followed succeeded in uniting the church and empire, a number of differences soon developed in a church separated by geography, language, politics, and theology."
These differences came to a head in the early eleventh century when the church separated into East and West over the issue of papal authority.
"Though attempts at reconciliation were made, the divide between East and West was further solidified by the Crusades and violent altercations that took place in Constantinople."
