The Church of England Breaks with Rome
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 1521–1603
Description: England separated from Rome and established the ruling monarch as head of the Church of England.
Summary: The English Reformation was both a political and religious movement.
"The initial challenge to Rome was not in opposition to the church's doctrine, but to the authority of the pope."
"Henry VIII's pursuit of an annulment from his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, which had not resulted in a male heir, was denied by the pope and led to an intense political confrontation with Rome."
"The king eventually declared himself the supreme authority over the Church of England, cutting ties to the church in Rome."
"In the decades that followed, both Protestants and Catholics attempted to shape the newly independent Church of England."
"A compromise was finally reached during the reign of Elizabeth I, a blend of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism which defined the Anglican Church."
