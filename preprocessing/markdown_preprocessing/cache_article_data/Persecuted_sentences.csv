Persecuted
The Early Church Is Persecuted
Period: !!smallcaps|ad!! 64–312
Description: Christians experienced persecution within the Roman Empire during the first few centuries after the birth of the church.
"Summary: As the church stepped out on its own and spread across the Roman Empire, followers of Jesus faced persecution and martyrdom."
"At first, persecution consisted of sporadic, isolated events, but the threat to those called ""Christians"" eventually became widespread as punishment and violence were sanctioned by the emperors of Rome."
"Christian apologists came to the defense of the new faith, advocating for tolerance and acceptance of Christianity while encouraging followers to remain faithful in the face of persecution and martyrdom."
Key Developments
Christianity spread across the Roman Empire despite periods of persecution by the Roman Empire (64–312).
Christianity was eventually recognized as separate from Judaism (late first century).
Christians were no longer exempt from pagan sacrifices (late first century).
The growing number of Christians presented a challenge to the paganism and imperialism of Rome (late first century).
"Christians were accused of atheism, cannibalism, and incest, which led to increased distrust of the new faith (100s–early 300s)."
Many apologetic defenses of the Christian faith were written (100s–early 300s).
Controversies over the treatment of lapsed Christians led to schisms within the church (200s–early 400s).
Persecution became increasingly violent and more widespread under the Roman Empire (250-311).
"Emperors began requiring sacrifices and declarations of ""Caesar is Lord"" (250)."
Christians were discharged from the Roman military (303–311).
Churches and Christian writings were burned and their leaders targeted during the Great Persecution (303–311).
"Tolerance was granted to Christians, and persecution was ended (311)."
